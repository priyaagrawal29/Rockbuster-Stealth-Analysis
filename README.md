# Rockbuster-Stealth-Analysis
## Project Summary
This project involves a comprehensive analysis of data from Rockbuster Stealth LLC, a movie rental company which is looking to launch an online video rental service. The objective of the analysis is to obtain answers to business questions from Rockbuster Stealth's management board and other departments which will help develop the launch strategy for the online video rental service and the company strategy for 2020. The results of the analysis conducted in SQL are then visualized using Tableau. The insights derived from the visualizations will help Rockbuster Stealth to develop an launch strategy for their new online video rental service to ensure that they stay competitive with existing streaming services such as Amazon Prime and Netflix.
